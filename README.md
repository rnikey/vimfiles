vimfiles
========

This is my vimfiles directory after doing a bit of working learning vim and setting up my editor.
It contains all my setup files associated with Vim.  Includes my vimrc and plugins that I wrote.

I'm using pathogen, and my plugins are in the bundles directory.

There are two plugins that I wrote, one to put the output of the last ex
command into the buffer, and the other to use the arrow keys more
consistently with other applications.
